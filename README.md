"Hyta" is a novel Python library that provides financial indicators for technical analysis, with a noteworthy emphasis on incremental computation. The library's incremental computation feature makes it particularly suitable for real-time applications or any other application that involves iterative input.

As a relatively new project, "hyta" is highly receptive to user feedback and suggestions for improving its API to meet users' unique needs.
